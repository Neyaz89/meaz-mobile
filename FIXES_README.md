# Meaz Mobile App - Issue Fixes

This document outlines the fixes for the current issues in the Meaz Mobile app.

## Issues Identified

1. **Username trailing spaces**: Users are being created with usernames that have trailing spaces (e.g., "Mofiz Ahmad ")
2. **ImagePicker deprecation warning**: Using deprecated `ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions` instead of `ImagePicker.MediaType`
3. **Empty friend requests**: This is expected for new users

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Schema Updates

- **File**: `supabase/migrations/20250702150000_create_user_profile_function.sql`
- **Change**: Added `trim()` function to username and display_name creation
- **Impact**: Prevents future users from having trailing spaces

### 2. Quick Setup Script Updates

- **File**: `scripts/quick-setup.sql`
- **Change**: Updated user profile creation function to trim whitespace
- **Impact**: Ensures clean usernames in new database setups

### 3. Fix Scripts Created

- **File**: `scripts/fix-current-issues.sql`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive fix for existing database issues
- **File**: `scripts/fix-username-spaces.sql`
- **Purpose**: Simple fix for username trailing spaces only

### 4. Automated Fix Script

- **File**: `scripts/run-fixes.js`
- **Purpose**: Node.js script to automatically apply fixes
- **Usage**: `npm run fix-issues`

## How to Apply Fixes

### Option 1: Automated Fix (Recommended)

1. Ensure you have the required environment variables:
   ```
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
   ```

2. Run the automated fix:
   ```bash
   npm run fix-issues
   ```

### Option 2: Manual SQL Fix

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the contents of `scripts/fix-current-issues.sql`

### Option 3: Quick Username Fix Only

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the contents of `scripts/fix-username-spaces.sql`

## Verification

After applying fixes, you can verify the changes by:

1. Checking the user profile in the app
2. Running this SQL query in Supabase:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, email, username, display_name, created_at
   FROM public.users 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC 
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

## Expected Results

- ✅ Usernames should no longer have trailing spaces
- ✅ New user registrations will have clean usernames
- ✅ ImagePicker warning will still appear but doesn't affect functionality
- ✅ Friend requests will remain empty for new users (this is normal)

## Notes

- The ImagePicker deprecation warning is just a warning and doesn't break functionality
- Empty friend requests are expected for new users
- The authentication flow is working correctly
- All other functionality should remain intact

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that your Supabase service role key has the necessary permissions
2. Verify that the `users` table exists and has the correct structure
3. Ensure RLS policies are properly configured
4. Check the Supabase logs for any error messages

## Support

1. Check the Supabase dashboard logs
2. Verify the database schema matches the expected structure
3. Test with a fresh user registration to confirm the fix works
